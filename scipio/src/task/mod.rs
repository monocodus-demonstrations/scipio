//! Task abstraction for building executors.
//!
//! # Spawning
//!
//! To spawn a future onto an executor, we first need to allocate it on the heap and keep some
//! state alongside it. The state indicates whether the future is ready for polling, waiting to be
//! woken up, or completed. Such a future is called a *task*.
//!
//! All executors have some kind of queue that holds runnable tasks:
//!
//! ```
//! # use std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel;
//! #
//! # // a queue of task to eventually execute
//! # let (sender, receiver) = sync_channel(10);
//! #
//! # // A future that will get spawned.
//! # let future = async { 1 + 2 };
//! #
//! # // A function that schedules the task when it gets woken up.
//! # let schedule = move |task| sender.send(task).unwrap();
//! #
//! # // Construct a task.
//! # let (task, handle) = scipio::task::spawn(future, schedule, ());
//! ```
//!
//! A task is constructed using either [`spawn`] or [`spawn_local`]:
//!
//! ```
//! # use std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel;
//! #
//! # // a queue of task to eventually execute
//! # let (sender, receiver) = sync_channel(10);
//! #
//! // A future that will be spawned.
//! let future = async { 1 + 2 };
//!
//! // A function that schedules the task when it gets woken up.
//! let schedule = move |task| sender.send(task).unwrap();
//!
//! // Construct a task.
//! let (task, handle) = scipio::task::spawn(future, schedule, ());
//!
//! // Push the task into the queue by invoking its schedule function.
//! task.schedule();
//! ```
//!
//! The last argument to the [`spawn`] function is a *tag*, an arbitrary piece of data associated
//! with the task. In most executors, this is typically a task identifier or task-local storage.
//!
//! The function returns a runnable [`Task`] and a [`JoinHandle`] that can await the result.
//!
//! # Execution
//!
//! Task executors have some kind of main loop that drives tasks to completion. That means taking
//! runnable tasks out of the queue and running each one in order:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel;
//! #
//! # // a queue of task to eventually execute
//! # let (sender, receiver) = sync_channel(10);
//! #
//! # // A future that will get spawned.
//! # let future = async { 1 + 2 };
//! #
//! # // A function that schedules the task when it gets woken up.
//! # let schedule = move |task| sender.send(task).unwrap();
//! #
//! # // Construct a task.
//! # let (task, handle) = scipio::task::spawn(future, schedule, ());
//! #
//! # // Push the task into the queue by invoking its schedule function.
//! # task.schedule();
//! #
//! for task in receiver {
//!     task.run();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! When a task is run, its future gets polled. If polling does not complete the task, that means
//! it's waiting for another future and needs to go to sleep. When woken up, its schedule function
//! will be invoked, pushing it back into the queue so that it can be run again.
//!
//! # Cancellation
//!
//! Both [`Task`] and [`JoinHandle`] have methods that cancel the task. When canceled, the task's
//! future will not be polled again and will get dropped instead.
//!
//! If canceled by the [`Task`] instance, the task is destroyed immediately. If canceled by the
//! [`JoinHandle`] instance, it will be scheduled one more time and the next attempt to run it will
//! simply destroy it.
//!
//! The `JoinHandle` future will then evaluate to `None`, but only after the task's future is
//! dropped.
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! Task construction incurs a single allocation that holds its state, the schedule function, and
//! the future or the result of the future if completed.
//!
//! The layout of a task is equivalent to 4 `usize`s followed by the schedule function, and then by
//! a union of the future and its output.
//!
//! # Waking
//!
//! The handy [`waker_fn`] constructor converts any function into a [`Waker`]. Every time it is
//! woken, the function gets called:
//!
//! ```
//! let waker = scipio::task::waker_fn(|| println!("Wake!"));
//!
//! // Prints "Wake!" twice.
//! waker.wake_by_ref();
//! waker.wake_by_ref();
//! ```
//!
//! This is useful for implementing single-future executors like [`block_on`].
